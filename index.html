                <p class = "paraContent"> During my time at UCSD I have compelted two codepath certificates,
                    one in <strong>Intermediate Web Development</strong> and one in <strong>Intermediate Techinical Interview Prep</strong>.
                    From these course I was able to create <b>2</b> main projects on the side. <em>RoamMates</em> and <em>Recipe Dashboard</em>. 
                    In these projects I was able to demonstrate my ability of CRUD features, API calls, graphing technologies, and database mangment.
                    Prior to taking my CSE 134B class I would always try to put everything into <code>divs</code> since that I was most familiar with in formatting everything.
                    But after taking this course I have been able to finally realize that their are other html tags that work the same if not better than divs in some scenarios.
