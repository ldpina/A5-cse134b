Somethings I changed from my origninal project was updating all the bio details in the homepage where everything is more descriptive and removed unnecessary html tags like <aside> and <strike>. For CSS I went back to change some the size of the paragraph text and centered my <details> tags to be able to display the new picture I added in the center.
